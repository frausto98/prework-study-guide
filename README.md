# Prework Study Guide

## Description:
This Study Guide was created with the newest entrees to the bootcamp in mind. It is aimed to help understand what's to be explored over the course of the next 12 (or 24) weeks, and to also provide a sense of relief to those who may struggle, such as myself. It provides a valuable resource to anyone who needs a bit of information, and is also retranslated into someone else's words, so you may get another understanding, if it is impossible to understand from a techincal document.
